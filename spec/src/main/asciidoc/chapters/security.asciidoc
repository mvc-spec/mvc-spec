Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Guarding against malicious attacks is a great concern for web application developers. In particular, MVC applications that accept
input from a browser are often targetted by attackers. Two of the most common forms of attacks are cross-site request forgery (CSRF) 
and cross-site scripting (XSS). This chapter explores techniques to prevent these type of attacks with the aid of the MVC API.

[[cross-site-request-forgery]]
Cross-site Request Forgery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack in which a user, who has a trust relationship with a certain site, is mislead into
executing some commands that exploit the existence of such a trust relationship. The canonical example for this attack is that of a user
unintentionally carrying out a bank transfer while visiting another site.

The attack is based on the inclusion of a link or script in a page that accesses a site to which the user is known or assumed to have been
authenticated (trusted). Trust relationships are often stored in the form of cookies that may be active while the user is visiting other
sites. For example, such a malicious site could include the following HTML snippet:

[source,html]
----
<img src="http://yourbank.com/transfer?from=yours&to=mine&sum=1000000">
----

This will result in the browser executing a bank transfer in an attempt to load an image.

In practice, most sites require the use of form posts to submit requests such as bank transfers. The common way to prevent CSRF attacks is by
embedding additional, difficult-to-guess data fields in requests that contain sensible commands. This additional data, known as a token, is
obtained from the trusted site but unlike cookies it is never stored in the browser.

MVC implementations provide CSRF protection using the `Csrf` object and the `@CsrfValid` annotation.
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-obj]#The `Csrf` object is available to applications via the injectable `MvcContext` type or in EL as `mvc.csrf`#.
For more information about `MvcContext`, please refer to the <<mvc_context>> section.

[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-hidden-field]#Applications may use the `Csrf` object to inject a hidden field in a form that can be validated upon submission#.
Consider the following JSP:

[source,html,numbered]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CSRF Protected Form</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form action="csrf" method="post" accept-charset="utf-8">
            <input type="submit" value="Click here"/>
            <input type="hidden" name="${mvc.csrf.name}"
                value="${mvc.csrf.token}"/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
----

The hidden field will be submitted with the form, giving the MVC implementation the opportunity to verify the token and ensure the
validity of the post request.

Another way to convey this information to and from the client is via an HTTP header.
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-verify]#MVC implementations are REQUIRED to support CSRF tokens both as form fields (with the help of the application developer as shown above) and as HTTP headers#.

The application-level property `javax.mvc.security.CsrfProtection` enables CSRF protection when set to one of the possible values defined in `javax.mvc.security.Csrf.CsrfOptions`.
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-opt-default]#The default value of this property is `CsrfOptions.EXPLICIT`#.
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-inject-header]#Any other value than `CsrfOptions.OFF` will automatically inject a CSRF token as an HTTP header#.
The actual name of this header is implementation dependent.

[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-implicit]#Automatic validation is enabled by setting this property to `CsrfOptions.IMPLICIT`, in which case all post requests must include either an HTTP header or a hidden field with the correct token#.
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-explict]#Finally, if the property is set to `CsrfOptions.EXPLICIT` then application developers must annotate controllers using `@CsrfValid` to manually enable validation as shown in the following example#.

[source,java,numbered]
----
@Path("csrf")
@Controller
public class CsrfController {

    @GET
    public String getForm() {
        return "csrf.jsp"; // Injects CSRF token
    }

    @POST
    @CsrfValid // Required for CsrfOptions.EXPLICIT
    public void postForm(@FormParam("greeting") String greeting) {
        // Process greeting
    }
}
----

[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-mediatype]#MVC implementations are required to support CSRF validation of tokens for controllers annotated with `@POST` and consuming the media type `x-www-form-urlencoded`#;
other media types and scenarios may also be supported but are OPTIONAL.

If CSRF protection is enabled for a controller method and the CSRF validation fails (because the token is either missing or invalid),
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-exception]#the MVC implementation MUST throw a `javax.mvc.security.CsrfValidationException`#.
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-default-mapper]#The implementation MUST provide a default exception mapper for this exception which handles it by responding with a 403 (Forbidden) status code#.
[tck-testable tck-id-csrf-custom-mapper]#Applications MAY provide a custom exception mapper for `CsrfValidationException` to change this default behavior#.

[[cross-site-scripting]]
Cross-site Scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of attack in which snippets of scripting code are injected and later executed when returned back from a
server. The typical scenario is that of a website with a search field that does not validate its input, and returns an error message that
includes the value that was submitted. If the value includes a snippet of the form `<script>...</script>` then it will be executed by the browser when
the page containing the error is rendered.

There are lots of different variations of this the XSS attack, but most can be prevented by ensuring that the data submitted by clients is
properly _sanitized_ before it is manipulated, stored in a database, returned to the client, etc. Data escaping/encoding is the recommended
way to deal with untrusted data and prevent XSS attacks.

[tck-testable tck-id-xss-encoders-obj]#MVC applications can gain access to encoders through the `MvcContext` object#;
[tck-testable tck-id-xss-escaping]#the methods defined by `javax.mvc.security.Encoders` can be used by applications to contextually encode data in an attempt to prevent XSS attacks#.
The reader is referred to the Javadoc for this type for further information.
