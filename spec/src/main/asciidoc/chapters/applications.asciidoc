Applications
------------

This chapter introduces the notion of an MVC application and explains how it relates to a JAX-RS application.

[[mvc_applications]]
MVC Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An MVC application consists of one or more JAX-RS resources that are annotated with `@Controller` and, just like JAX-RS applications, zero or more providers. If no
resources are annotated with `@Controller`, then the resulting application is a JAX-RS application instead. In general, everything that applies to a JAX-RS application
also applies to an MVC application. Some MVC applications may be _hybrid_ and include a mix of MVC controllers and JAX-RS resource methods.

The controllers and providers that make up an application are configured via an application-supplied subclass of `Application` from JAX-RS. An implementation 
MAY provide alternate mechanisms for locating controllers, but as in JAX-RS, the use of an `Application` subclass is the only way to guarantee portability.

The path in the application's URL space in which MVC controllers live must be specified either using the `@ApplicationPath` annotation on the application
subclass or in the web.xml as part of the `url-pattern` element. MVC applications SHOULD use a non-empty path or pattern: i.e., _"/"_ or _"/*"_ 
should be avoided whenever possible. 
The reason for this is that MVC implementations often forward requests to the Servlet container, and the use of the aforementioned
values may result in the unwanted processing of the forwarded request by the JAX-RS servlet once again.

[[mvc_context]]
MVC Context
~~~~~~~~~~~

MVC applications can inject an instance of `MvcContext` to access configuration, security and path-related information. Instances of `MvcContext` are provided
by implementations and are always in request scope [<<mvc:mvc-context>>].
For convenience, the `MvcContext` instance is also available using the name `mvc` in EL.

As an example, a view can refer to a CSS file by using the context path available in the `MvcContext` object as follows:

[source,html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${mvc.contextPath}/my.css">
----

For more information on security see the Chapter on <<security,Security>>; for more information 
about the `MvcContext` in general, refer to the Javadoc for the type.

[[providers_in_mvc]]
Providers in MVC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementations are free to use their own providers in order to modify the standard JAX-RS pipeline for the purpose of implementing the MVC semantics. Whenever mixing 
implementation and application providers, care should be taken to ensure the correct execution order using priorities.

[[annotation_inheritance]]
Annotation Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MVC applications MUST follow the annotation inheritance rules defined by JAX-RS [<<mvc:annotation-inheritance>>]. Namely, MVC annotations may be used on methods of a 
super-class or an implemented interface. Such annotations are inherited by a corresponding sub-class or implementation class method provided that the method does 
not have any MVC or JAX-RS annotations of its own: i.e., if a subclass or implementation method has any MVC or JAX-RS annotations then all of the
annotations on the superclass or interface method are ignored.

Annotations on a super-class take precedence over those on an implemented interface. The precedence over conflicting annotations defined in multiple implemented 
interfaces is implementation dependent. Note that, in accordance to the JAX-RS rules, inheritance of class or interface annotations is not supported.
