Summary of Assertions
---------------------
[[mvc:controller]]
*\[[mvc:controller]]* Controller methods are JAX-RS resource methods annotated with `@Controller`.

[[mvc:all-controllers]]
*\[[mvc:all-controllers]]* All resource methods in a class annotated with `@Controller` must be controllers.

[[mvc:void-controllers]]
*\[[mvc:void-controllers]]* Controller methods that return void must be annotated with `@View`.

[[mvc:cdi-beans]]
*\[[mvc:cdi-beans]]* MVC beans are managed by CDI.

[[mvc:per-request]]
*\[[mvc:per-request]]* Default scope for MVC beans is request scope.

[[mvc:validation-result]]
*\[[mvc:validation-result]]* If validation fails, controller methods must still be called if a `ValidationResult` field or property is defined.

[[mvc:event-firing]]
*\[[mvc:event-firing]]* All events in `javax.mvc.event` must be fired. See Javadoc for more information on each event in that package.

[[mvc:builtin-engines]]
*\[[mvc:builtin-engines]]* Implementations must provide support for JSPs and Facelets.

[[mvc:extension-engines]]
*\[[mvc:extension-engines]]* CDI beans that implement `javax.mvc.engine.ViewEngine` provide an ex- tension mechanism for view engines.

[[mvc:selection-algorithm]]
*\[[mvc:selection-algorithm]]* Implementations must use algorithm in the <<selection_algorithm>> section to select view engines.

[[mvc:request-forward]]
*\[[mvc:request-forward]]* Forward request for which no view engine is found.

[[mvc:exception-wrap]]
*\[[mvc:exception-wrap]]* Exceptions thrown during view processing must be wrapped.

[[mvc:view-resolution]]
*\[[mvc:view-resolution]]* Relative paths to views must be resolved as explained in the <<selection_algorithm>> section.

[[mvc:null-controllers]]
*\[[mvc:null-controllers]]* The `@View` annotation is treated as a default value for any controller method that returns a null value.

[[mvc:redirect]]
*\[[mvc:redirect]]* Support HTTP redirects using the redirect: prefix and a controller return type of String.

[[mvc:annotation-inheritance]]
*\[[mvc:annotation-inheritance]]* Annotation inheritance is derived from JAX-RS and extended to MVC annotations.

[[mvc:csrf-options]]
*\[[mvc:csrf-options]]* CSRF support for configuration options defined by `Csrf.CsrfOptions`.

[[mvc:csrf-support]]
*\[[mvc:csrf-support]]* CSRF validation required only for controllers annotated by `@POST` and consuming the media type `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

[[mvc:mvc-context]]
*\[[mvc:mvc-context]]* Application-scoped `MvcContext` available for injection and as `mvc` in EL.

[[mvc:request-locale-context]]
*\[[mvc:request-locale-context]]* The `MvcContext` must provide access to the current request locale.

[[mvc:extension-resolvers]]
*\[[mvc:extension-resolvers]]* CDI beans implementing `javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver` provide an extension mechanism for the request locale resolving algorithm.

[[mvc:resolve-algorithm]]
*\[[mvc:resolve-algorithm]]* The request locale must be resolved as described in the <<i18n_resolving_algorithm>> section.

[[mvc:default-locale-resolver]]
*\[[mvc:default-locale-resolver]]* Implementations must provide a default locale resolver as described in the <<i18n_default_resolver>> section.
