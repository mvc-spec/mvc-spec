\chapter{Introduction}

Model-View-Controller, or {\em MVC} for short, is a common pattern in Web frameworks 
where it is used predominantly to build HTML applications. The {\em model} refers to the 
application's data, the {\em view} to the application's data presentation and the 
{\em controller} to the part of the system responsible for managing input, updating models 
and producing output.

Web UI frameworks can be categorized as {\em action-based} or {\em component-based}. In an action-based 
framework, HTTP requests are routed to controllers where they are turned into actions by application code; 
in a component-based framework, HTTP requests are grouped and typically handled by framework components
with little or no interaction from application code. In other words, in a component-based framework,
the majority of the controller logic is provided by the framework instead of the application.

The API defined by this specification falls into the action-based 
category and is, therefore, not intended to be a replacement for component-based frameworks such as
JavaServer Faces (JSF) \cite{jsf}, but simply a different approach to building Web applications on the 
Java EE platform.

\section{Goals}
\label{goals}

The following are goals of the API:

\begin{description}
\item[Goal 1] Leverage existing Java EE technologies. 
\item[Goal 2] Integrate with CDI \cite{cdi} and Bean Validation \cite{bv}.
\item[Goal 3] Define a solid core to build \mvc\ applications without necessarily supporting all the 
features in its first version.
\item[Goal 4] Explore layering on top of \jaxrs\ for the purpose of re-using its
matching and binding layers.
\item[Goal 5] Provide built-in support for JSPs and Facelets view languages.
\end{description}

\section{Non-Goals}
\label{non_goals}

The following are non-goals of the API:

\begin{description}
\item[Non-Goal 1] Define a new view (template) language and processor.
\item[Non-Goal 2] Support standalone implementations of \mvc\ running outside of Java EE.
\item[Non-Goal 3] Support REST services not based on \jaxrs.
\item[Non-Goal 4] Provide built-in support for view languages that are not part of Java EE.
\end{description}

It is worth noting that, even though a standalone implementation of \mvc\ that runs outside
of Java EE is a non-goal, this specification shall not intentionally prevent implementations
to run in other environments, provided that those environments include support for all the 
EE technologies required by \mvc.

\section{Terminology}
\label{terminology}

Most of the terminology used in this specification is borrowed from other specifications 
such as \jaxrs\ and CDI. We use the terms {\em per-request} and {\em request-scoped} as
well as {\em per-application} and {\em application-scoped} interchangeably.

\section{Conventions}

The keywords `MUST', `MUST NOT', `REQUIRED', `SHALL', `SHALL NOT', `SHOULD', `SHOULD NOT', 
`RECOMMENDED', `MAY', and `OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
RFC 2119\cite{rfc2119}. 

Assertions defined by this specification are formatted as {\textbf{\llb{an-assertion}\rrb}} 
using a descriptive name as the label and are all listed in Appendix \ref{assertions}.

Java code and sample data fragments are formatted as shown in figure \ref{ex1}:

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\caption{Example Java Code}
\label{ex1}
\begin{listing}{1}
package com.example.hello;

public class Hello {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}\end{listing}
\end{figure}

URIs of the general form `http://example.org/...' and `http://example.com/...' represent application 
or context-dependent URIs.

All parts of this specification are normative, with the exception of examples, notes and sections
explicitly marked as `Non-Normative'. Non-normative notes are formatted as shown below.

\begin{nnnote*}
This is a note.
