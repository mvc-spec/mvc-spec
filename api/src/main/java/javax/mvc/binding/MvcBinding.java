/**
 * This annotation is used to enable MVC-specific binding rules for a JAX-RS parameter binding. It can
 * be placed on fields and method parameters together with JAX-RS binding annotations such as
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.FormParam}, {@link javax.ws.rs.QueryParam}, etc.
 * <p>
 * MVC parameter binding differs from traditional JAX-RS parameter binding in the following aspects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>In JAX-RS binding and validation errors result in an exception being thrown which can
 * only be handled by a corresponding exception mapper. This usually doesn't make sense for web
 * applications, because errors must be processed by the controller, so they can be
 * displayed on the resulting HTML page. In case of MVC bindings such errors don't prevent the controller
 * from being invoked and are instead made available via the injectable {@link BindingResult} class.</li>
 * <li>JAX-RS parameter type conversion isn't locale-aware. The standard JAX-RS converters
 * always use a fixed locale to parse numbers and dates. In MVC applications users typically
 * enter data into forms in their native locale. Therefore, MVC bindings perform data type
 * conversion by respecting the request locale resolved via {@link javax.mvc.locale.LocaleResolver}.</li>
 * </ul>
