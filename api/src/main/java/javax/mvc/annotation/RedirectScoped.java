/**
 * An annotation that defines a new CDI-based scope supported by the MVC API.
 * Beans in this scope are automatically created and destroyed by correlating
 * a redirect and the request that follows. The exact mechanism by which requests
 * are correlated is implementation dependent, but popular techniques include URL
 * rewrites and cookies.
