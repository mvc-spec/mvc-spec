/**
 * <p>View engines are responsible for processing views and are discovered
 * using CDI. Implementations must look up all instances of this interface,
 * and process a view as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Gather the set of candidate view engines by calling {@link #supports(String)}
 *     and discarding engines that return <code>false</code>.</li>
 *     <li>Sort the resulting set of candidates using priorities. View engines
 *     can be decorated with {@link javax.annotation.Priority} to indicate
 *     their priority; otherwise the priority is assumed to be {@link ViewEngine#PRIORITY_APPLICATION}.</li>
 *     <li>If more than one candidate is available, choose one in an
 *     implementation-defined manner.</li>
 *     <li>Fire a {@link javax.mvc.event.BeforeProcessViewEvent} event.</li>
 *     <li>Call method {@link #processView(ViewEngineContext)} to process view.</li>
 *     <li>Fire a {@link javax.mvc.event.AfterProcessViewEvent} event.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>The default view engines for JSPs and Facelets use file extensions to determine
 * support. Namely, the default JSP view engine supports views with extensions <code>jsp</code>
 * and <code>jspx</code>, and the one for Facelets supports views with extension
 * <code>xhtml</code>.</p>
